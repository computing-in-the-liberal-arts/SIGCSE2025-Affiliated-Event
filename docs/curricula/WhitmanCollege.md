- Degree(s) offered: BA
- Department/major name: Computer Science
- Number of contributing faculty: ~5 FTE

- Other context: Whitman's computer science major is less than ten years old, first appearing in the catalog for the 2017-18 academic year.

## Description of Curricular Innovation

Our innovation is in an innovation of _process_. 
Whitman College is the first institution to design a computer science curriculum based on the 
[Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/) under development by the 
[SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/).

Existing curriculum (briefly! focus on describing characteristics, rationale, and challenges rather than listing courses)

Summer workshop process and outcomes
- Outcomes: New deliberation and decision-making processes that we could carry forward to future curriculum design activities; program-level identity statement; draft program-level learning outcomes

Fall working group process and outcomes

Proposed new curriculum (in comparison to the existing curriculum?)

Future work?

## Challenges/Limitations

Whitman's curriculum was designed for Whitman: 
our faculty, our student population, and our institutional context. 
Rather than adopting our curriculum, we recommend using the process laid out in the Curricular Practices Workbook. 

Our process benefited from two facilitators external to our department: 
for the summer workshop, a Workbook co-author, 
and for the fall working group, a Math colleague interested in curricular reform.
This facilitation enabled all four members of the department to focus mainly on the content of our work, 
and we do not think we would have been as efficient or successful without it.

Notetheless, this curricular revision required a significant time investment:
20 hours of summer workshop meetings, 10 hours of fall working group meetings, and about as many hours of individual work.
