## Description of Curricular Innovation

Our innovation is in an innovation of _process_. 
Whitman College is the first institution to design a computer science curriculum based on the 
[Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/) under development by the 
[SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/).

Existing curriculum (briefly! focus on describing characteristics, rationale, and challenges rather than listing courses)

Whitman's current CS program was designed for the inaugural Computer Science major in the mid 2010's. 
The department needed to demonstrate to various constituencies that Whitman's fledgeling program would be 
"rigorous" and cover the "foundations" of the discipline, yet be covered by only three full-time 
faculty on a 3-2 teaching load. 
As such, our curriculum requirements were composed of 10 specifically required courses adhering very closely to the 
Core Tier-1 and Tier-2 ACM 2013 curricular guidelines and one elective. 
By 2023, that curriculum felt increasingly constraining on both our faculty and students, both of which 
were more numerous and eager for more flexibility to engage in a broader range of courses.

We planned our curricular revision around a week-long workshop in the summer of 2024, 
supported by an internal institutional grant for pedagogical development and facilitated 
by Andrea Tartaro, a co-author of the [Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/).
A core premise of the workbook is that curriculum design should be closely 
informed by institutional values, mission, and constraints. 
Before the workshop, we collected various resources that captured that institutional 
context, including the college's current mission statements, notes from several years 
of senior exit interviews, and individual reflections on our aspirations for the 
educational experiences and outcomes we wanted for our students.
We also mapped our current current curriculum according to the ACM 2023 Curricular Guidelines (CS2023)
Knowledge Areas.

Summer workshop process and outcomes
- Process: I'm guessing we don't want to spend much time re-iterating what is in the workbook, since we can reference that. So, important process details include the organization of the activities, facilitation techniques (with a heavy focus on collaborative deliberation and decision-making), toggling between collaborative discussions/working sessions and daily individual homework assignments
- Outcomes: New deliberation and decision-making processes that we could carry forward to future curriculum design activities; program-level identity statement; draft program-level learning outcomes
- JAS: I think there's more we might need to say to cover this. I didn't spend a lot of time on the workbook, but an outline seemed worthwhile.

During the workshop itself, guided by the workbook and our facilitator, we 
developed our goals for our new curriculum in a few steps over several days of discussion:
0. Establish ground rules for collaboration and discussion
1. Articulate an aspirational identity statement for our program
2. Document design principles to be used in crafting a program according to our stated values
3. Draft program-level learning outcomes
4. Map our learning outcomes to the ACM CG Knowledge Areas and identify program "Competency Areas"
5. Reflect on our current program to identify areas of alignment and misalignment to our developing program vision
These steps took the full week, leaving us with areas of revision to work on to develop changes to our curriculum 
to align it with our program's vision within our program's constraints.

At the end of the workshop, we identified several key goals that would require curricular revision to achieve, such as:
* Broaden entry points into the major, points of engagement for nonmajors, and opportunities for in-class discussion of social topics by redesigning some core courses to require _no_ prerequisites.
* Reduce the number of specifically required courses and enable more opportunity for student choice in electives.
* Intentionally develop students' abilities to acquire skills progressively more independently to better prepare them for capstone and lifelong learning after graduation.

During the fall semester, we met roughly weekly to work through the details of a revised curriculum, 
equipped with our notes from the workshop and the continued support of an interested faculty member 
from our Mathematics and Statistic department as our new facilitator. 
These meetings roughly followed the following process:
1. Presentations of individually imagined curricula capturing various ideas of how we might carry out our program vision
2. Identification of common themes and specific new courses for further development
3. Discussion of new and revised courses and their mapping to the CS2023 Knowledge Areas
4. Synthesis of new major requirements, including reevaluation of alignment to program vision, learning outcomes, and design principles from the summer workshop
5. Documentation of a curriculum transition plan and submission of formal course and program proposals

Our resulting curriculum includes many substantial changes. 
The number of directly required courses has decreased to 7, making room for requiring multiple 
open elective courses within our institution's major credit limits. 
An eighth course requirement offers a selection to encourage students to explore more deeply 
into a core area of computer science (systems, theory, or design) that could facilitate 
undergraduate research or graduate school opportunities.
No required course (including capstone) has a prerequite chain of more than two courses, 
and enabling students as late as their seconnd year to discover the program and still 
complete it within eight semesters.
The major will also specifically require new 100-level courses in discrete mathematics and computer systems, 
which we are developing with no prerequisites to enable multiple opportunities for majors and nonmajors 
alike to first engage with foundational concepts and perspectives offered by our discipline. 

At time of writing, we still need to revise our program's full description in the college catalog, 
establish methods of assessment for our new program learning outcomes, and document our final reflections 
for our internal grant and external facilitator on our use of the Curricular Practices Workbook.
Our curricular changes will be incrementally rolled out over the next several years, 
beginning with the lowest level courses, while we teach out the upper level courses 
of our current curriculum for already declared majors. 

## Challenges/Limitations

Whitman's curriculum was designed for Whitman: 
our faculty, our student population, and our institutional context. 
Rather than adopting our curriculum, we recommend using the process laid out in the Curricular Practices Workbook. 

Our process benefited from two facilitators external to our department: 
for the summer workshop, a Workbook co-author, 
and for the fall working group, a Math colleague interested in curricular reform.
This facilitation enabled all four members of the department to focus mainly on the content of our work, 
and we do not think we would have been as efficient or successful without it.

Notetheless, this curricular revision required a significant time investment:
20 hours of summer workshop meetings, 10 hours of fall working group meetings, and about as many hours of individual work.
