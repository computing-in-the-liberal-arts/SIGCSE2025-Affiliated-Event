## Description of Curricular Innovation

Our innovation is in an innovation of _process_. 
Whitman College is the first institution to design a computer science curriculum based on the 
[Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/) under development by the 
[SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/).

Whitman's current CS program was designed for the inaugural Computer Science major in the mid-2010's. 
The CS faculty needed to demonstrate that Whitman's fledgling program represented a rigorous academic discipline,
but at the same time needed to design a curriculum to be taught by only three full-time faculty on a 3-2 teaching load. 
As such, our curriculum requirements were composed of 10 specifically required courses, adhering closely to the 
Core Tier-1 and Tier-2 ACM 2013 curricular guidelines, and one elective. 
By the early 2020's, that curriculum felt constraining for both faculty and students.

We planned our curricular revision around a week-long workshop in the summer of 2024, 
supported by an internal institutional grant for pedagogical development and facilitated 
by Andrea Tartaro, a co-author of the [Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/).
A core premise of the Workbook is that curriculum design should be closely 
informed by institutional values, mission, and identity. 
Before the workshop, we collected various resources that captured that institutional 
context, including the college's current mission statements, notes from several years 
of senior exit interviews, and individual reflections on our aspirations for the 
educational experiences and outcomes we wanted for our students.
We also mapped our current current curriculum according to the Knowledge Areas of the [ACM 2023 Curricular Guidelines (CS2023)](https://csed.acm.org/cs2023-report-with-feedback/).

During the workshop itself, guided by the Workbook and our facilitator, we 
developed our goals for our new curriculum in a few steps over several days of advance readings, individual homework, and discussion.
Our discussions focused on these six steps:

0. Establish ground rules for collaboration, discussion, and decision making;
1. Articulate an aspirational identity statement for our program;
2. Document design principles to be used in crafting a program according to our stated values;
3. Draft program-level learning outcomes;
4. Map our learning outcomes to the [CS 2023](https://csed.acm.org/cs2023-report-with-feedback/) Knowledge Areas and identify program "Competency Areas";
5. Reflect on our current program to identify areas of alignment and misalignment to our developing program vision.
   
Step 0 was not part of the Workbook but required by our administration as a condition of funding an external facilitator.
These steps took the full week, leaving us with areas of revision to work on to develop changes to our curriculum 
to align it with our program's vision within our program's constraints.

By the end of the workshop, we had identified several key goals that would require curricular revision to achieve, such as:

* Redesign some core courses to require _no_ prerequisites in order to broaden entry points into the major, and increase points of engagement for nonmajors and opportunities for in-class discussions of social and ethical topics.
* Reduce the number of required courses to enable more opportunity for student choice in electives.
* Intentionally develop students' abilities to acquire skills progressively and independently to prepare them for capstone and lifelong learning after graduation.

During the fall semester, we met roughly weekly to work through the details of a revised curriculum, 
equipped with our notes from the workshop and the continued support of an interested faculty member 
from Whitman's Mathematics and Statistics Department as our new facilitator. 

These meetings roughly followed the following process, going beyond the content of the [Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/):

1. Presentations of individually imagined curricula capturing various ideas for how we might carry out our program vision;
2. Identification of common themes and specific new courses for further development;
3. Discussion of new and revised courses and their mapping to the CS2023 Knowledge Areas;
4. Synthesis of new major requirements, including reevaluation of alignment to program vision, learning outcomes, and design principles from the summer workshop;
5. Development of a curriculum transition plan along with formal course and program proposals.

Our resulting curriculum includes many substantial changes. 
The number of directly required courses has decreased to 7, making room to require multiple 
major elective courses within our institution's limits on credits required for a major. 
An eighth course requirement offers a selection to encourage students to venture more deeply 
into a core area of computer science (systems, theory, or design) that could facilitate 
undergraduate research or graduate school opportunities.
No required course (including capstone) has a prerequite chain of more than two courses, 
enabling students to discover the program as late as their second year and still 
graduate within eight semesters.
The major will also require new 100-level courses in discrete mathematics and computer systems, 
which we are developing with no prerequisites to enable multiple opportunities for majors and non-majors 
alike to engage with foundational concepts and perspectives offered by our discipline. 

At time of writing, our proposals are moving through institutional approval processes.
We still need to document our further reflections on our use of the Curricular Practices Workbook and
establish methods of assessment for our new program learning outcomes.
Our curricular changes will be incrementally rolled out over the next several years, 
beginning with the lowest level courses, while we teach out the upper level courses 
of our current curriculum for currently declared majors. 

## Challenges/Limitations

Whitman's curriculum was designed for Whitman: 
our faculty, our student population, and our institutional context. 
Rather than adopting our curriculum, we recommend using the process laid out in the [Curricular Practices Workbook](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/CS2023/). 
We believe that the added space for electives better deals with balancing ACM topic coverage with the expertise of our approximately 5 FTE faculty, allows for further program growth, and student freedom to explore and engage with the liberal arts and interdisciplinary programs.

Our process benefited from two facilitators external to our department: 
for the summer workshop, a Workbook co-author, 
and for the fall working group, a Math colleague interested in curricular reform.
External facilitation enabled all four members of the department to focus mainly on the content of our work, 
and we do not think we would have been as efficient or successful without it.
The curricular revision process still required a significant time investment from each of us:
20 hours of summer workshop meetings, 10 hours of fall working group meetings, and about as many hours of individual work.

We hesitated to make weighty decisions about our curriculum while one of our tenure lines remains unfilled.
However, we believe that our revised curriculum will let all current faculty contribute to most (if not all) required courses,
while also making more space for each of us to contribute unique elective offerings.
We are hopeful that our revised curriculum will accommate new colleagues with minimal adaptations.
